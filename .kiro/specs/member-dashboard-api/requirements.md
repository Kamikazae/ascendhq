# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a backend API endpoint for the member dashboard that replaces the current mock data with real database queries. The API will provide member-specific statistics including objectives count, completion status, team memberships, and overall progress calculations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a member user, I want to see my dashboard statistics populated from real data, so that I can track my actual progress and objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a member accesses the dashboard API THEN the system SHALL return their total number of objectives across all teams
2. WHEN a member accesses the dashboard API THEN the system SHALL return the count of their completed objectives
3. WHEN a member accesses the dashboard API THEN the system SHALL return the number of teams they belong to
4. WHEN a member accesses the dashboard API THEN the system SHALL calculate and return their overall progress percentage
5. WHEN a member accesses the dashboard API THEN the system SHALL return their recent objectives with status and team information
6. WHEN a member accesses the dashboard API THEN the system SHALL return progress breakdown by team for visualization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a member user, I want the dashboard API to be secure, so that I can only see my own data and not other members' information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access the dashboard API THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
2. WHEN an authenticated member accesses the dashboard API THEN the system SHALL only return data for objectives and teams they are associated with
3. WHEN a member tries to access another member's dashboard data THEN the system SHALL prevent access and return a 403 forbidden error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a member user, I want the dashboard API to perform efficiently, so that my dashboard loads quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard API is called THEN the system SHALL use optimized database queries with appropriate joins
2. WHEN the dashboard API is called THEN the system SHALL return the response within 500ms under normal load
3. WHEN calculating progress THEN the system SHALL aggregate key result progress efficiently without multiple round trips

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a member user, I want to access my objectives through a dedicated API endpoint, so that I can view detailed information about all my objectives across teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a member accesses the my-objectives API THEN the system SHALL return all objectives for teams they belong to
2. WHEN a member accesses the my-objectives API THEN the system SHALL include objective details, progress, and key results
3. WHEN a member accesses the my-objectives API THEN the system SHALL only return objectives they have access to through team membership
4. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access my-objectives API THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a member user, I want to access my teams through a dedicated API endpoint, so that I can view and manage my team memberships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a member accesses the my-teams API THEN the system SHALL return all teams they are a member of
2. WHEN a member accesses the my-teams API THEN the system SHALL include team details and member information
3. WHEN a member accesses the my-teams API THEN the system SHALL only return teams where they have membership
4. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access my-teams API THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard API to follow consistent patterns, so that it integrates well with the existing codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the API endpoints THEN the system SHALL follow the existing Next.js API route patterns
2. WHEN implementing the API endpoints THEN the system SHALL use the existing Prisma client for database operations
3. WHEN implementing the API endpoints THEN the system SHALL return JSON responses with consistent error handling
4. WHEN implementing the API endpoints THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript for type safety
