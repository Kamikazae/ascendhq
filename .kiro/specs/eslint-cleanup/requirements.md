# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the ESLint warnings and errors currently present in the codebase after fixing TypeScript compilation issues. The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices by systematically resolving linting issues while maintaining functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be free of ESLint errors, so that code quality standards are maintained and the development experience is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint runs THEN there SHALL be zero `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` errors
2. WHEN ESLint runs THEN all type assertions SHALL use proper TypeScript interfaces instead of `any`
3. WHEN ESLint runs THEN authentication checks SHALL use strongly typed session objects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused imports and variables to be removed, so that the codebase is clean and bundle size is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint runs THEN there SHALL be zero `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` warnings
2. WHEN a component imports an icon or utility THEN it SHALL actually use that import
3. WHEN a function parameter is not used THEN it SHALL be prefixed with underscore or removed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want JSX content to properly escape special characters, so that React best practices are followed and potential rendering issues are avoided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSX contains quotes or apostrophes THEN they SHALL be properly escaped using HTML entities
2. WHEN ESLint runs THEN there SHALL be zero `react/no-unescaped-entities` errors
3. WHEN text contains special characters THEN they SHALL use appropriate HTML entities like `&apos;`, `&quot;`, etc.
