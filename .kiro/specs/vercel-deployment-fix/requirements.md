# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the remaining deployment and module resolution issues in the Next.js application when deploying to Vercel. The application currently has path alias resolution problems, middleware configuration issues, and build failures that prevent successful deployment and runtime execution on Vercel's platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build successfully on Vercel without module resolution errors, so that the deployment process completes without failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built on Vercel THEN the build process SHALL complete without TypeScript path alias resolution errors
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN all `@/` imports SHALL resolve correctly to their corresponding file paths
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN the module resolution SHALL work consistently between local and Vercel environments
4. IF path aliases are used THEN the build system SHALL properly resolve them using the tsconfig.json configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the middleware to function correctly in the Vercel edge runtime, so that authentication and routing work as expected in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN middleware executes on Vercel THEN it SHALL NOT throw runtime errors related to Node.js-specific APIs
2. WHEN a user accesses protected routes THEN the middleware SHALL properly redirect unauthenticated users to the signin page
3. WHEN middleware processes requests THEN it SHALL handle static assets and API routes correctly without interference
4. IF authentication is required THEN the middleware SHALL integrate properly with NextAuth.js without causing deployment failures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all UI components to import and render correctly in production, so that the application interface works without missing components or styling issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components are imported using path aliases THEN they SHALL resolve correctly in the production build
2. WHEN the application renders THEN all shadcn/ui components SHALL display properly without import errors
3. WHEN component dependencies are resolved THEN the build process SHALL include all necessary component files
4. IF components use utility functions THEN the imports SHALL resolve correctly across the entire component tree

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application configuration to be optimized for Vercel deployment, so that the app runs efficiently and reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application deploys to Vercel THEN the configuration SHALL be optimized for the platform's requirements
2. WHEN Next.js builds the application THEN the configuration SHALL support proper module resolution and compilation
3. WHEN the application runs in production THEN it SHALL use appropriate runtime settings for Vercel's environment
4. IF custom configurations are needed THEN they SHALL be properly defined in vercel.json and next.config.ts files
